# Statement of Intent

- A 200-word design statement of intent or introduction to your design project.

# Analysis of the design problem/issue/subject/proposition

- What is the design question or problem or proposition?
How can we promote type as a standalone aesthetic element in the Vietnamese design market?

- What are you proposing to do and why?
A platform that focuses on type and type alone; a conversational piece that can spark discussion and interest among Vietnamese designers in particular and the Vietnamese art community in general.

While my aim is to promote the typographic style and to see it better represented in Vietnam, it is very easy to cross the line between promoting and educating. Early ideation reveals that while the market is definitely lacking in this regard, the ego of the designer can make them quite stubborn. The aim is to not force any ideas, but merely to give the community insights into something that they may have neglected, a place where type is the center of discussion.
