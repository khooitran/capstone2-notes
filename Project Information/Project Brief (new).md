# Statement of Intent

- A 200-word design statement of intent or introduction to your design project.

ViệtType is a website platform & zine publisher focusing on Vietnamese typographic culture. The project aims to uplift the typographic movement in Vietnam, giving typographers and type designers in Vietnam a commonplace where the focus is on type and type alone.

The project stems from a certain context of typography in Vietnam: While type designers in Vietnam are often recognised by the global design community, the coverage of these people’s works in Vietnam do not achieve quite the same effect. The content is definitely there, but what is missing is a place where these designers can share their process and little bits of stories. I want to make this open to the public, so that more people can bounce off of their ideas, much similar to how they inspired me.

The main focus of the project will be on contemporary Vietnamese typographers and type designers, which will be displayed in two formats: A website where stories, events, and new typographic content are updated via blogs, and a periodically produced zine that goes into deeper detail about stories from people actively participating in the Vietnamese typographic community, whether they are typographers, type designers, or graphic designers. The project hopes to serve as an artistic outlet of typographic content that doubles as a newsletter for Vietnamese typography, which will inspire other designers in Vietnam to follow these people’s footsteps and create a bigger community.

# Analysis of the design problem/issue/subject/proposition

- What is the design question or problem or proposition?

How can we promote type as a standalone aesthetic element in the Vietnamese design market?

- What are you proposing to do and why?
A platform that focuses on type and type alone; a conversational piece that can encourage discussion and interest among Vietnamese designers in particular and the Vietnamese art community in general.

This is to promote the typographic works of Vietnamese designers within the Vietnamese design market and creating a commonplace for Vietnamese typographic content to nurture.

# Research & Context

- Project Mapping
- Why is this project important to you (Personal scale)?
I want to explore the possibilities of typography. The project will give me that satisfaction being able to both engage in a highly typographic project while also getting to know the people and the scene in Vietnam.
- Why is this project important to others (Societal Scale)?
While the typographic works from Vietnamese designers have received ample praise from the global design community, the same effect cannot be seen here in Vietnam. Designers often work independently from each other, without a commonplace to trade ideas and to inspire each other. I want to create a piece of design where these works are the main focus.
- What approach are you going to take?
Real typefaces, real people, real stories. I want the product to be very true and detailed, as true to the spirit of the zine.
- What is you project theme (e.g. speculative, technical, experimental, etc)?
Technical.
- Articulate your initial academic research, and if appropriate, include: data analysis, surveys, market research and persona study.
- Provide examples of design precedents and the community of practice
- Who is your intended target audience or users with rationale?
- Why are they appropriate and important to your project?

# Initial Development Work

- What are the concept and ideas for your design outcomes/solution?
- Show your initial ideas and sketches
- Storytelling/narrative - what is the 'story' behind your design?
- Scenarios or Experience Map (before, during, and after)

# Expected Outcomes

- The amount of design outcomes should reflect a double credit course
Zine + Website

# Practical Requirement and potential problems

- What resources and tools do you need to create your final design outcomes?
- What possible issues or problems might affect the development of your work?
- How would you deal with such problems or issues?

# Schedule

- Provide a schedule and timeline of work
