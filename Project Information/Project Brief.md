### Purpose

To *promote* typography to aspiring designers looking to learn more about it.

### Concept Context

- Functional Value
[[Don Norman's Principles of Design]]
The project hopes to function as an *entry point* to typography for the Vietnamese design population. From this value, the website should be *interactive*, fun and engaging to make it easier for beginners to start.

- Personal Value
As a typographic website, the website should follow the International Typographic Style, a design method that is personally favoured. This also helps me create a something that can differentiate myself from others.

- Emotional Value
Typography is a relatively rigid form of design. I would like to make clear the values of the style that evokes these characteristics, including: logical, clean, clear, and detail-oriented.

- Sustainable Value
By doing a website, it results in much less waste in comparison to a book, while offering more publicity. The project is also much more editable in the long run, so it is also more sustainable in that sense. I do want it to be more of a long-term project.

## Buzzwords

- Interactive
- Typographic
- Entry point
- Simplistic
- Clean
- Duotone

### Questions

- Why should we do this?
I feel like typography has been an emerging style of design, together with the movement of the design as a career in general in Vietnam. With that, I think that most typography teaching materials are presented in English, with very few options in Vietnamese. Typography is something that the Vietnamese language provides an unique challenge of diacritics, which I think should be made known among Vietnamese designers first before it is presented globally.

- Who for?
The project aims at new Vietnamese designers who are looking to learn more about Typography and Type Design. The info will be basic, but certain sections will cater specifically to the Vietnamese alphabet, in which foreign designers looking to know more about the Vietnamese letter system can also benefit from. However, there are better sources for this endeavour, namely [this website about Vietnamese diacritics](https://vietnamesetypography.com).

- How are we doing this?
I want to make an interactive website that introduces concept through gamification or interactivity. This hopefully will lower the entry barrier for a rigid style as Typography.

- What may the outcome be?
A working website, ready to publish. 

- Why do this now?
I was inspired from Duong Tran's talk earlier this year. Hearing him talk about the current situation regarding type in Vietnam make me want to contribute to the emerging community of typographers and type designers. As previously stated, the project comes at a good time when design as a whole and typography in particular is emerging.

- What will you discover?
I will discover the typographic scene in Hanoi and in Vietnam, and connect to like-minded people.

- What will you learn?
I will dive much deeper into typography and type design, something that I have always wanted to do. I will also need to learn to make a very interactive, easy-to-navigate website which is a step up from the usual static website that I have been learning to create.

- How will you evaluate this?
I hope to be able to create a real website, with sections, or chapters, to introduce people to typography and type design. The structure will be laid out to be created one by one.

- How will you communicate your aims?
This is through a series of mock-ups, which will then be developed into an actual website. I really want it to be a proper website and not a Figma prototype, which would defeat the purpose of creating a website in the first place.

- Will you collaborate? (who with?/why them?)
I may have to consult Duong Tran about the type design terminologies and some knowledge, but I do think that most of my job is to translate from English and add the Vietnamese uniqueness to it, which I do think I have the ability to do and I do like doing it.

### Brief Sections

- Target audience
Aspiring Vietnamese designers looking to learn about typography and type design in the Vietnamese context.

- Function
To guide users through a series of small games and exercise to help lay the foundation of typography.

- Problem statement
While typography is emerging again in Vietnam, the resources available are usually scarce. The problem gets worse when these sources specifically caters to the Vietnamese alphabet and population.

- Design statement
The project hopes to fill this gap of lacking sources, and help lay a foundation in typography so that designers can then branch out to discover more about the style.

- Rationale
I want to promote the style of typography in Vietnam, as designs now focuses on aesthetic, eye-catchiness, and quickness. I think neutrality, timelessness, and cleanliness are characteristics of the International Typographic style that can be applied in the Vietnamese market. I do not think that this project alone will shift the Vietnamese design market, but I do think that it is a step towards the right direction.

### Objectives

- Project aims
The project aims to make typography easier to access for designers in Vietnam.

- Impact
The project hopes to make the International Typographic style a more mainstream style of design in Vietnam.

### Approach

- Incorporating Cultural Values
The stacked diacritics makes the Vietnamese alphabet unique. With this in mind, the project makes sure that this is clarified during production.

- Tone of Voice
Neutral.

- Considerations
The information has to be easy to grasp, and the website's functions has to make it easier to get a grasp of these concepts.

- Restrictions
The project can be utilised by designers well-versed in typography and foreign designers, but it is not catered to these audiences. Better sources are available.
