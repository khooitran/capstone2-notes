### Purpose

To *promote* typography to aspiring designers looking to learn more about it.

### Concept Context

- Functional Value
[[Don Norman's Principles of Design]]
The project hopes to function as an *entry point* to typography for the Vietnamese design population. From this value, the website should be *interactive*, fun and engaging to make it easier for beginners to start.

- Personal Value
As a typographic website, the website should follow the International Typographic Style, a design method that is personally favoured. This also helps me create a something that can differentiate myself from others.

- Emotional Value
Typography is a relatively rigid form of design. I would like to make clear the values of the style that evokes these characteristics, including: logical, clean, clear, and detail-oriented.

- Sustainable Value
By doing a website, it results in much less waste in comparison to a book, while offering more publicity. The project is also much more editable in the long run, so it is also more sustainable in that sense. I do want it to be more of a long-term project.

## Buzzwords
