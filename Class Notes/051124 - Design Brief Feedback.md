Will I make a typeface to go with this?
I'm considering it.

The project needs to be more unique & expressive. The overall style & approach needs to be more playful & energetic. I agree with this since the project focuses mostly towards young aspiring designers.

Keep options open in terms of design outcomes. I think that a magazine is very much sealed; however, I think that the website can drop for something more valuable. I do agree that the website as it stands right now do not provide much value to the project.
