# Capstone 2 Notes

This Github repository contains all the notes for my Capstone 2 Project of the Bachelor of Design Studies of RMIT University Hanoi.

The repository utilises Obsidian as a way to edit the notes, but it is viewable from Github directly.

The repository is utilised to move notes from my PC at home to my Laptop at work/school, and also to refer to anyone who would like to take a peek at all the notes that I have written down for the project, including myself.

Please have a look through the README file to have an overview of the structure of the notes.

# Structure

The notes is structured using the "Zettelkasten" ("slipbox") method, which included links in between notes, most famously utilised by Wikipedia.

The notes are structured using the "Zettelkasten" folder, which include links to all the notes, which are divided in two ways:

### Folders

The folders are themes of the notes, which include:

- [[CLASS NOTES]]: Notes taken in class.
- [[PROJECT INFORMATION]]: Reflections from in-class notes and key ideas and directions of the project.
- [[RESEARCH]]: research.

### Weeks

Notes are also divided into weeks, which serves as a chronological arrangement of the notes, primarily for Process Book development. This is found in the **Weeks** folder.

[[WEEK 01]]
[[WEEK 02]]
[[WEEK 03]]
[[WEEK 04]]
[[WEEK 05]]
[[WEEK 06]]
[[WEEK 07]]
[[WEEK 08]]
[[WEEK 09]]
[[WEEK 10]]
[[WEEK 11]]
[[WEEK 12]]

The notes themselves will also have links to other relevant notes, much like on Wikipedia.

Thank you for taking an interest in what my project! I hope the notes will provide another perspective onto the design process and the way I work.
